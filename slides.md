We are especially interested in major challenges you
face when performing image analysis, any training efforts you do to
transfer the skills of image analysis, and the computational tools
(software, data structures, packages, workflows) you develop or rely

## 0.20 â€” released!

71 authors, 42 reviewers, 275 pull requests merged!

- Anisotropic images in `skimage.measure`
- Performance improvements, e.g. footprint decomposition in `skimage.morphology`
  <img src="images/footprint_decomposition.png" width="40%"/>
- More N-dimensional support
- More consistent API, including `channel_axis` for indicating multi-channel images
- New build system: Meson

...

## skimage 2.0

Motivation:

- Organic API growth over a decade
  - Harmonization of concepts such as random seed
- Early design decisions
  - Data type range inferral
  - `transform` module coordinate convention
- Operations on non-NumPy array containers

[SKIP3](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/skips/3-transition-to-v1.html), [SKIP4](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/skips/4-transition-to-v2.html)

...

## A pragmatic pathway

[A Pragmatic Pathway Towards skimage2](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/a-pragmatic-pathway-towards-skimage2/530/24)

Principles for a transition (my opinion):

1. Do not estrange your existing user base.
2. Ensure transitioning of majority of users.
3. Do not place an undue burden on maintainers.
4. Initially, allow using old and the new APIs in conjunction.

A potential route:

1. Release `skimage2` (still distributed as pip install `scikit-image`).
2. This package contains both `skimage` and `skimage2` libraries.
3. Over time, deprecate the functions in `skimage` with instructions.
4. Eventually remove `skimage`, with instructions.

Notes:

- Do not want to estrange a large part of our existing user base. This implies making any porting of code straightforward (a challenge with the Py 2 to 3 port was that you had to read and think about the code you were porting; it was not just a matter of applying certain prescribed recipes).

- Ensure that most users eventually land on skimage2. If, e.g., we provided a supported skimage1 and skimage2, there would be no incentive to transition.

- Do not place an undue burden on maintainers. This would, e.g., preclude long term support of both skimage1 and skimage2.

- Initially, allow users to use the old and the new APIs in conjunction (this should help greatly in porting code).

## Challenges

...

### Software development in academia (I)

- Lacking credit & evaluation (still papers)
- Few suitable academic positions

Despite:

- Impact
- Better science
  - User-developers
  - Science more transparent, reproducible, verifiable
  - Open work often more collaborative

...

#### Software development in academia (II)

You can help:

- Contribute or support students who want to contribute
- Reward and recognize efforts outside of paper writing
- Fund open, not closed software (and convince the NSF/NIH/... to do the
  same!)
- Apply lessons from open source computational research software to your work:
  1. Test research code
  2. Executable papers (AKA automate everything)
  3. Collaborate widely, credit all those involved
  4. Insist on open code & data (reviewing and publishing)

### Sustained support

**CZI EOSS (Cycle 5)**

- [skimage 2.0 API transition, types, and maintenance grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/from-library-to-protocol-scikit-image-as-an-api-reference/)
  - Outreachy Internships
    - Projects:
      1. Enhance image warping in scikit-image with thin-plate spines
      2. Expand scikit-image gallery with biomedical examples (narrative documentation)
    - Currently in contribution period
    - Interns announced May 4th; internship from May 29th to August 25th

**Scientific Python**

Immediate goals:

1. Coordinate (e.g., SPECs, discussion forums)
2. Support & develop shared infrastructure (`yaml2ics`, `devpy`, ...)
3. Get projects funded
4. Foster the next generation of contributors
